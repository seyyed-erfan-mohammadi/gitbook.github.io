# Bridging the MEG Gap

Traditional pre-processing workflows are fragmented, labor-intensive, and prone to inconsistencies—especially for large-scale datasets. Enter MEGAP (MEG Automatic Pipeline), a groundbreaking solution designed to bridge this critical gap. By automating noise removal, artifact correction, and standardization, MEGAP transforms the chaos of raw MEG data into clean, reproducible outputs. This pipeline not only addresses the limitations of existing tools—such as manual parameter tuning, incomplete artifact handling, and reliance on outdated filtering methods—but also empowers researchers to unlock the full potential of MEG with unprecedented efficiency.

Welcome to the future of MEG pre-processing. Let’s close the gap!
